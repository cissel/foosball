# fetchNflRookieData.R
# Rookie prior data: draft capital + combine athletic testing + landing-spot
# opportunity, for players with NO NFL usage history (can't use the normal
# lag1-usage Phase 2 model). Covers 2015-2026 draft classes for training +
# scoring the 2026 rookie class.
#
# NOTE ON DATA SOURCE: originally planned to use final college-season box
# score stats (College Dominator Rating, breakout age - the strongest known
# WR predictor per public research) via cfbfastR/CollegeFootballData.com, but
# CFBD now requires a free API key for registration James didn't want to set
# up mid-session. WORKED AROUND with nflreadr::load_combine() (NFL Scouting
# Combine athletic testing: 40-yard dash, vertical, broad jump, bench, cone,
# shuttle) instead - this is an established substitute used in real fantasy
# analytics (RotoViz Speed Score, PlayerProfiler Burst Score) when box score
# data isn't available. Coverage: 74-99% depending on metric, no API key
# needed. Revisit with real college dominator/breakout-age data if James
# registers for a CFBD key later - it's the stronger WR signal per public
# research, this combine-based version is the honest fallback.
#
# Usage: Rscript fetchNflRookieData.R

# Speed Score (Bill Barnwell's formula, standard in the industry): normalizes

# 190lb WR at the same time. Higher = better explosiveness-adjusted speed.
# Burst Score (PlayerProfiler convention): vertical + broad_jump, explosiveness.
