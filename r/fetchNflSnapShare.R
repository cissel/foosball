# fetchNflSnapShare.R
# Player-season snap share and target share (offense only) from nflverse.
# Purpose: distinguish "starter getting real volume" from "name-value backup"
# for the fantasy projection model - depth chart position matters more than
# raw talent for weekly fantasy floor/ceiling.
#
# Usage: Rscript fetchNflSnapShare.R [start_year] [end_year]
# Default: 2018 2024 (snap count data coverage starts ~2012 but PFR-sourced
# snap data is most reliable from ~2016 on; player_stats has receiving targets
# for the target-share half)

# silently resolve to the aggregated scalar, not the per-week vector (this bit us once).
