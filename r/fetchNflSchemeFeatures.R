#!/usr/bin/env Rscript
# fetchNflSchemeFeatures.R
# Team-season offensive scheme/pace features from nflverse PBP.
# Captures play-calling tendency (PROE = pass rate over expected) independent
# of game script, plus pace and situational pass rates. Designed to be joined
# with a coaching-staff table (team/season -> HC/OC/DC) so tendencies can be
# re-attributed to a COACH (travels across team moves) rather than staying
# stuck to a team identity.
#
# Usage: Rscript fetchNflSchemeFeatures.R [start_year] [end_year]
# Default: 2015 2024
