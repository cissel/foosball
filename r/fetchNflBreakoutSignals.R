# fetchNflBreakoutSignals.R
# Phase 5: raw signal inputs for the 2nd/3rd-year breakout candidate score.
# Three outputs, all keyed off 2025 season data (the last full season before
# the 2026 draft):
#   1. breakout_efficiency_2025.csv - per-player NGS rate efficiency (position-
#      specific: QB CPOE/EPA, RB RYOE/efficiency, WR/TE separation+YAC-oe),
#      sample-gated so small-sample-size players don't get spurious extreme
#      efficiency reads.
#   2. breakout_usage_trend_2025.csv - each player's snap_share/target_share
#      in the back half of 2025 (weeks 10-18) minus the front half (weeks
#      1-9). Trend, not level - a player finishing hot on volume is a better
#      bet than one flat all year even at the same season-average share.
#   3. breakout_team_vacancy_2026.csv - per 2025 team, how much target_share
#      (pass-catchers) and rush_attempt share (backs) is walking out the door
#      via free agency/retirement/cut before 2026, using the 2026 roster
#      (ACT status) as "who's still here." This is the situational-tailwind
#      signal - a team losing its top target earner opens a real, measurable
#      opportunity for whoever's left.
