# buildNflTrainingPanel.R
# Builds the Phase 2 training panel: predicts season T fantasy points using
# only information KNOWN BEFORE season T starts -
#   - player's role/usage from season T-1 (target share, snap share, volume)
#   - player's age + aging-curve position curve for season T
#   - season T's coaching situation (coach scheme signature is already built
#     from strictly-prior seasons, new_hc/new_oc flags, scheme_uncertainty_flag)
#   - draft capital / experience (static)
# Target: room40_pts, room40_pts_per_game in season T.
#
# This mirrors the MLB pipeline's leakage-prevention convention (shift(1)
# before rolling) - here the "rolling window" is just "last season", so we
# lag every usage feature by one season before joining to the target season.

# ---- team-change flag: did this player change teams from the PRIOR season? ----
# Motivation (found 2026-08 during a live-draft-tool review flagging
# Wan'Dale Robinson as a suspiciously overvalued recommendation): usage
# features (lag1_target_share, lag1_snap_share_avg) are carried forward at
# face value regardless of whether the player is still on the SAME team
# that earned them that role. A player who earned a 32% target share as
# their old team's clear WR1 does not automatically keep that role after
# changing teams into a crowded depth chart - but nothing in the model
# previously captured that. Empirically verified this is a REAL, material
# effect (not just this one player): among WR/TE with lag1_target_share >
# 0.20, team-changers saw their share erode much further next season
# (24.7% -> 19.6%) than players who stayed (25.7% -> 23.6%), and scored
# meaningfully fewer points per game (9.5 vs 12.2 pts/game). Let the model
# LEARN the right discount empirically via this flag + its interaction
# with lag1_target_share, rather than hand-picking a penalty multiplier.
