# joined with their team-season's coach scheme signature (PROE/pace/red-zone,
# attributed to the coordinator's career identity, not just team continuity).
# This is the complete Phase 1 feature table for the NFL moneyball project -
# ready to feed Phase 2 (projection model).

# NAME NORMALIZATION: snap_share is sourced from PFR (via nflreadr snap
# counts, "player" col e.g. "D.K. Metcalf") and target_share is sourced from
# nflverse play-by-play rosters ("player_display_name" col e.g. "DK Metcalf",
# with suffix conventions like "Chris Godwin Jr." vs snap's "Chris Godwin").
# An EXACT string join here silently splits one real player into two
# incomplete rows whenever the two sources format a name differently -
# confirmed 2026-07-29: 153 player-seasons across 2018-2025 affected (28 in
# 2025 alone - DK Metcalf, Chris Godwin, DJ Moore, Deebo Samuel, Michael
# Pittman among them), each showing up as a target_share-only row (no snap
# data) AND a separate snap_share-only row (no target data) instead of one
# complete row. Both get silently dropped downstream by buildNfl2026Projections.py's
# core-feature dropna(), so those players vanish from the VORP board entirely
# with no error or warning. Fix: join on a normalized name key (strip
# periods, strip Jr./Sr./II/III/IV suffixes, lowercase) instead of the raw
# string, in addition to team/season/position.
