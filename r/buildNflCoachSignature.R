# buildNflCoachSignature.R
# Builds a coach-level historical scheme signature (career PROE, pace, red zone
# pass rate) that TRAVELS with a coordinator/HC across team changes, instead of
# being reset to league-average whenever a team hires someone new. This is the
# whole point of tracking coach identity rather than just team continuity.
#
# Method: join coaching_staff.csv (who called plays for which team-season) with
# team_scheme_features.csv (what that team-season's play-calling actually looked
# like), grouped by OC name. For a given team-season, the "coach signature" is
# the OC's CAREER-TO-DATE (prior seasons only, no leakage) games-weighted average
# scheme stats from every team he's coordinated for. First season for any OC has
# no prior history -> falls back to league-average PROE that year (documented in
# SPARSE_FEATURES pattern, same as MLB pipeline's day-of features).
#
