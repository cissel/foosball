#
# Phase 4 extension: per-player consistency metrics from 2025 weekly fantasy
# points, requested by James for the live draft tool alongside ADP dispersion
# - "how many points did this guy score on average, how much did that vary
# week to week, and what's the risk-adjusted return" (same instinct as his
# SPY Sharpe work, applied to weekly fantasy scoring).
#
# Reuses the exact Room 40 scoring formula from fetchNflCareerData.R (same
# constants - keep both in sync if league scoring settings ever change):
#   pass_yd=0.04  pass_td=4   pass_int=-1  pass_2pt=2
#   rush_yd=0.1   rush_td=6   rush_2pt=2
#   rec=1 (PPR)   rec_yd=0.1  rec_td=6     rec_2pt=2
#   fum_lost=-2
#
# METRICS (2025 regular season, weekly):
#   games_played   - weeks with any recorded stat line
#   mean_pts       - average room40_pts per game played
#   sd_pts         - population stdev of room40_pts across games played
#   sharpe_pts     - mean_pts / sd_pts (higher = more weekly-consistent
#                    scorer relative to their own volatility - NOT the same
#                    as "good", a low-mean/low-sd role player can out-Sharpe
#                    a high-mean/high-variance boom/bust player; read
#                    alongside mean_pts, not instead of it)
#
# CAVEATS (be upfront about these in any display of this data):
#   - Single season (2025) only, not multi-year - a small-sample estimate,
#     same statistical-power caveat as any 17-week-max stdev.
#   - Injury-shortened seasons produce artificially low games_played and can
#     inflate/deflate sharpe_pts on very few data points - games_played is
#     included specifically so callers can flag/filter low-sample players
#     rather than trusting a Sharpe computed on 3 games the same as one on 17.
#   - sd_pts of 0 or near-0 (e.g. a player with 1 game played) makes
#     sharpe_pts explode/undefined - guarded to NA below rather than Inf.
