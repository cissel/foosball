buildNflBreakoutScore.py

Phase 5, step 2: composite breakout-candidate score for 2nd/3rd-year
skill-position players ahead of the 2026 season. Combines five z-scored
signal families into one composite, per position, then flags the top
3-5 per position as "breakout candidates" (surfaced downstream as a star
on the cheatsheet PNG and the live /nfl draftboard tool).

Eligibility for the breakout pool:
  - position in QB/RB/WR/TE
  - years_exp in {0, 1} as of end of 2025 season (entering year 2 or 3 in 2026)
  - sample gate: >= 8 games played in 2025 (avoid scoring a 3-game cameo)
  - NOT already a top-12 finisher at their position by 2025 room40_pts
    (that's "arrived," not "breaking out")

Composite score (all terms z-scored WITHIN position, within the eligible
pool only - so a WR is compared to other young WRs, not to QBs):

  breakout_z = eff_z + trend_z + tailwind_z + draft_capital_z + aging_z - crowding_z

  eff_z     : NGS rate efficiency (CPOE for QB, RYOE/att for RB, YAC-oe for
              WR/TE), SHRUNK toward the position mean by sample size before
              z-scoring (James-Stein-style shrinkage: shrunk = mean + (raw -
              mean) * n/(n+K)) so a rookie's 25-target efficiency spike
              doesn't get treated as equal-confidence to a 120-target season.
  trend_z   : average of z(snap_share_trend) and z(target_share_trend), where
              trend = back-half-of-2025 average minus front-half average.
              Usage TREND, not level - rewards players who were still
              climbing at year's end.
  tailwind_z: team-level situational opportunity opening up for 2026 -
              z(target_share vacated by departed pass-catchers) for
              WR/TE/RB, z(rush-attempt share vacated) for RB, plus a flat
              bonus for a new offensive coordinator (scheme uncertainty
              cuts both ways but on net favors an incumbent young player
              getting a clean-slate look).
  draft_capital_z: average of z(-draft_number) [pure draft-capital prior]
              and z(-draft_number) - z(lag1_room40_pts) [regression term:
              rewards early picks who UNDERPERFORMED their capital in 2025,
              since that gap is the textbook year-2/3 regression-up bet].
  aging_z   : combined_index(age in 2026) - combined_index(age in 2025) from
              the existing aging-curve model - the natural developmental
              slope for a player this young, quantified instead of asserted.
  crowding_z: (SUBTRACTED) the single highest target_share among 2025
              teammates at the same position who are still on the 2026
              roster, excluding the candidate themselves. Proxies "is there
              already an entrenched starter blocking this player's path."

CAVEATS surfaced in the output (not hidden):
  - Efficiency samples below the shrinkage K are still noisy even after
    shrinkage; treat close scores among low-sample_n players with more
    skepticism than the composite alone implies.
  - Crowding proxy only sees TEAMMATES ON THE 2025 ROSTER migrated forward to
    2026 - it can't see a same-position free agent /rookie the team hasn't
    drafted/signed yet, so a team could add a blocker after this runs.
  - Vacancy signal only sees departures already reflected in the 2026 roster
    snapshot (as of whatever nflreadr load_rosters(2026) has cached) - it
    will miss late-summer cuts/signings after that snapshot.
