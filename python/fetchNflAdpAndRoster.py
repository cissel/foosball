fetchNflAdpAndRoster.py

Phase 3 data pull: current 2026 ADP + roster/team mapping for all fantasy-
relevant players (QB/RB/WR/TE), sourced from Sleeper (free, no key, same API
already used for league settings). Sleeper's GraphQL projections endpoint
carries `adp_dd_ppr` (overall ADP) and `pos_adp_dd_ppr` (positional ADP) plus
its own baseline point projections we can use as a cross-check against our
Phase 2 model - if they disagree wildly, investigate before trusting VORP.

Why Sleeper over FantasyPros: FantasyPros ADP page renders via JS (no plain
HTML table, and their JSON API returns 403 without partner auth). Sleeper's
GraphQL is public, unauthenticated, and already proven reliable in this repo
(sleeperProj.py uses the same endpoint for weekly projections).

Usage: venv/bin/python3 python/fetchNflAdpAndRoster.py
Output: outputs/sports/nfl/fantasy/adp_2026.csv (current snapshot - overwritten
        every run, this is what all downstream tools read)
        outputs/sports/nfl/fantasy/adp_history.csv (daily long-format log,
        one row per player per snapshot_date, appended to on every run.
        Re-running same-day replaces that day's rows instead of duplicating,
        so safe to run more than once per day.) Added 2026-08-01 so ADP
        drift can be tracked day-over-day through the preseason - the
        cached snapshot had gone stale (3 days old) and drifted noticeably
        from the live Sleeper draft-room ADP James was seeing.

    NOTE: does NOT require p.get("team") to be set. Discovered 2026-07-29:
    Sleeper's `team` field is null for some rostered, active, real starters
    at the time of this pull (confirmed: Stefon Diggs, Tyreek Hill both
    showed team=None despite being active NFL players) - likely a roster
    sync lag on Sleeper's side around final cuts/trades. Requiring team was
    silently dropping real ADP-relevant players before they ever got an ADP
    lookup. Position-only filtering pulls in ~4x more candidates (~4000 vs
    ~970), but the ADP-presence dropna() downstream is the real relevance
    filter either way, so this is a size/latency tradeoff only, not a
