Phase 3, step 2: the actual "moneyball" layer. Computes Value Over Replacement
Player (VORP) using ROOM 40's ACTUAL roster math (not a generic 12-team
league assumption), then joins with current ADP to find market inefficiencies.

Room 40 settings (confirmed via Sleeper API, see nfl-room40-draft-prep.md):
  12 teams, roster: QB, RB, RB, WR, WR, TE, FLEX, K, DEF, BN x5
  Starting slots relevant to skill positions: 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 FLEX

Replacement level definition: the player ranked at the "last starter" spot
league-wide for that position, accounting for the shared FLEX slot (RB/WR/TE
eligible). This is standard fantasy sabermetric VORP methodology - replacement
level is NOT "average player", it's "the player you could get for free
(waiver wire) right after all 12 teams have finished drafting their starters."

FLEX allocation: rather than guess how the FLEX slot splits across RB/WR/TE,
derive it EMPIRICALLY from real historical Room 40 scoring - see
buildNflFlexSplit.py for full methodology. Per season 2019-2025: lock in
guaranteed starters (top 24 RB, top 24 WR, top 12 TE by real room40_pts),
pool everyone left over position-blind, and see who actually wins the 12
league-wide flex slots by points scored. Averaged across seasons, the split
came out ~95% WR / ~5% RB / ~0% TE - a genuinely lopsided result, but a real
one: Room 40 is full PPR (1.0 pt/reception, confirmed via Sleeper league
settings), and in full-PPR formats RB depth collapses hard past the top ~20
backs while WR depth stays flat much further down the position (the same
dynamic behind "Zero RB" draft strategies). This replaced a prior fixed
55/40/5 (RB/WR/TE) assumption that was itself inconsistent with this file's
own docstring, which separately claimed 60/35/5 - neither matched the data.
Falls back to the hardcoded split below only if the empirical CSV is missing.
