buildNflDraftStrategySim.py

Phase 4, step 4: roster-aware positional strategy simulator - answers "what
order should I actually draft positions in" by SIMULATING full 12-team snake
drafts under different named strategies and scoring the resulting STARTING
LINEUP's total VORP (not just "value drafted", which overcounts bench
depth you can't start).

This supersedes the static round-based scarcity chart (positional_scarcity.py)
by adding the piece that was missing: YOUR OWN ROSTER STATE. A position's
"scarcity" only matters to you relative to how many starter slots you still
need to fill - once your 2 RB slots are locked in, more RB is just bench
depth and should be valued accordingly.

METHOD:
  - Field (11 opponents) draft "best ADP available" each pick - a simple,
    standard proxy for market behavior. Not adaptive/strategic, but a
    reasonable baseline (this is the same assumption most public ADP-based
    mocks make).
  - User follows one of several named STRATEGIES (position-priority rules).
  - After a 15-round snake draft, score the user's team as the sum of VORP
    of their OPTIMAL starting lineup (best QB, best 2 RB, best 2 WR, best
    TE, best remaining RB/WR/TE for FLEX) - bench players contribute zero,
    same as they would on your actual scoreboard.
  - Repeat across all 12 draft slots (since positional value differs a lot
    between picking 1st vs 12th) and average per strategy.

STRATEGIES MODELED (first pass - simple, named, extensible):
  - zero_rb:    no RB in rounds 1-4, prioritize WR/TE/QB early, backfill RB late
  - hero_rb:    exactly one RB in round 1 if elite value present, then zero_rb after
  - robust_rb:  RB in rounds 1-2 if any RB available, else BPA
  - balanced:   fill starter slots (QB,RB,RB,WR,WR,TE) via best-available-at-need,
                then BPA for flex/bench
  - bpa:        pure best-player-available every pick regardless of position,
                capped at reasonable position limits so it doesn't hoard one
                position past usefulness

LIMITATIONS (be upfront - this is a "first pass", not a closed-form solver):
  - Field model is non-adaptive (always ADP-best), doesn't react to runs.
  - No trade logic, no injury news, no bye-week stacking considerations.
  - Only QB/RB/WR/TE modeled (matches VORP board scope) - no K/DEF rounds.
  - Single random-seed-free simulation per (strategy, slot) - deterministic
    given the ADP field assumption, not a Monte Carlo distribution. A future
    iteration could add opponent randomness for a confidence interval.
