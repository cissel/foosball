buildNflAgingCurve.py

Builds position-specific career/aging curves for fantasy football using the
delta method (standard sabermetric technique, avoids survivorship bias from
naive cross-sectional age averages).

Two curves per position:
  1. RATE curve  -- per-game production skill trajectory
  2. VOLUME curve -- games-played / availability trajectory
Combined -> full season-value career curve, indexed to peak age = 100.

Why the delta method:
A naive average of fantasy_pts by age is biased -- only good players are still
in the league at age 33+, so the cross-sectional average makes it look like
players get BETTER with age (survivorship). The delta method instead looks at
each player's OWN year-over-year change between consecutive seasons they
actually played, weighted by sample confidence (games played). Chaining those
deltas together reconstructs the true population aging curve without the bias.
