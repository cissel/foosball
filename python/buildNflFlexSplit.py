buildNflFlexSplit.py

Derives Room 40's FLEX allocation split (RB/WR/TE) EMPIRICALLY from real
historical fantasy scoring, instead of assuming a fixed hand-picked split.

Why this matters: VORP's replacement-level baseline for RB/WR/TE depends on
how many of the league's 12 shared FLEX slots (1 per team, RB/WR/TE eligible)
get "used up" by each position. A wrong split shifts every position's
replacement level and therefore every VORP score - see nfl-room40-draft-prep
skill notes for the mechanics.

Method (per season, then averaged):
  1. Lock in the guaranteed starters per Room 40's actual roster rules:
     top 24 RB, top 24 WR, top 12 TE (2/2/1 x 12 teams) by REAL room40_pts
     scored that season (not projections - this is retrospective/empirical).
  2. Pool everyone left over (RB25+, WR25+, TE13+) into one list, ranked
     purely by points scored, position-blind.
  3. Take the top 12 off that pooled list (1 FLEX slot x 12 teams) - however
     many are RB/WR/TE in that top 12 IS the empirical flex split for that
     season.
  4. Average the ratios across seasons 2019-2025 (matches the training
     panel's season window - see buildNflTrainingPanel.R) for stability
     rather than relying on any single year's idiosyncratic depth.
