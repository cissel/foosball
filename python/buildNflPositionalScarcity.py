buildNflPositionalScarcity.py

Phase 4, step 3 (basic version): a first data-driven pass at "what order
should I draft positions in", using the existing VORP/ADP pipeline rather
than guessing/anecdote (e.g. "Zero RB").

METHOD (intentionally simple - a starting point, not a full solver):
  1. Take the draftable pool (ADP <= 200, already built) and bucket every
     player into a "round" by their real market ADP (12-team league, so
     round = ceil(adp_overall / 12)). This approximates "when this player
     is typically gone" in a real draft.
  2. For each position x round, compute the MEAN VORP of players whose ADP
     falls in that round. This is "how much value is typically on the board
     at position P if you wait until round R to take it."
  3. Compute the round-over-round DROP in mean VORP per position. A big
     drop from round R to R+1 = a real cliff (scarce, must draft this round
     or lose real value). A small/flat drop = safe to wait (deep position).
  4. Surface, per round, which position has the steepest cliff coming up
     next round - i.e. a simple "priority order" signal for that pick.

LIMITATIONS (be upfront about these, don't oversell the basic version):
  - This assumes ADP order = draft order, i.e. it does NOT simulate actual
    draft flow, opponent behavior, or your own roster construction needs
    (e.g. you already have 2 RBs, so RB cliffs matter less to you now).
  - Uses mean VORP within a round bucket - a noisy model (this one has some
    high-variance rows, see injury-conflation caveat) means individual
    round means can bounce around; look at the SHAPE across rounds, not any
    single round in isolation.
  - Does not yet account for roster construction (how many of each position
    you still need) - that's the natural next iteration once this basic
    version is validated.
