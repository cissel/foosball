buildNflRookieTrainingPanel.py

Rookie prior training panel: predicts a player's ROOKIE-YEAR room40_pts using
only pre-NFL-usage information - draft capital, combine athletic testing, and
their team's landing-spot opportunity (vacated target/snap share). This is a
SEPARATE model from the main Phase 2 projection model, because rookies have
no lag1 NFL usage to feed the main model's features.
