buildNfl2026Projections.py

Phase 3, step 1: generate 2026 season fantasy point projections for every
player with current ADP, using the Phase 2 trained models (Ridge/GBM/LightGBM
per position) and each player's real 2025 season usage as the lag1 features.

Handles the name-matching between Sleeper (ADP source) and nflverse (features
source) - different name conventions require suffix stripping (Jr./Sr./III)
and accent normalization.

Rookies (no 2025 usage in nflverse - literally didn't play in the NFL last
year) cannot get a model prediction under our leakage-safe design (no lag1
features exist). They are flagged separately rather than silently dropped or
given a fabricated projection - James can layer rookie ADP-implied value on
top manually, or that's a natural Phase 3.5 extension (draft-capital based
rookie prior) if he wants it.

    training date and picks by val_spearman alone - it does NOT check that
    the feature schema matches what buildNfl2026Projections.py currently
    builds. If a stale model from before a feature-set change happens to
    score marginally better on val_spearman, this will silently select it
    and predict() will crash (or worse, silently mis-predict if the stale
    schema happens to be a subset) the next time features change. Mitigated
    for now by deleting stale pre-fix pkls (see nfl_experiment_log.csv
    2026-07-30 entries), but if this recurs, add a feature_cols equality
    check against the CURRENT FEATURE_COLS list before considering a
