buildNflRookieLandingSpot.py

Computes a "landing spot opportunity" feature for rookies: how much target
share / snap share is VACATED on the team they're drafted to, based on that
team's departing veterans (players who were on the roster the prior season
but are gone this season - retired, cut, traded away, or simply aged out of
the role). A rookie WR walking into a offense that just lost its WR1 to free
agency has a much clearer path to touches than one buried on a stacked depth
chart, independent of the rookie's own talent level - this is exactly the
kind of context draft capital alone doesn't capture.

Method: for team T in season S, sum target_share/snap_share_avg of every
player who logged >= 10% target share OR >= 20% snap share on that team in
season S-1, then flag how much of that departed player's share is now
"vacated" (their team in season S is different from season S-1, or they
have no season-S row in the league at all = retired/out of the league).
